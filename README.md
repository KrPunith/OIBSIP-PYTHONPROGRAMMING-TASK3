# OIBSIP-PYTHONPROGRAMMING-TASK3
Developed an advanced password generator with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter or PyQt. Enhance it by including options for password complexity, adherence to security rules, and clipboard integration for easy copying.
Objective:
To develop a program that generates strong and secure passwords automatically using random combinations of characters.

Steps Performed:

Imported necessary Python libraries like random and string.

Collected user input for password length and character preferences.

Combined uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.

Used random functions to shuffle and generate unique passwords.

Displayed the final password to the user for secure use.

Tools Used:
Python 3, IDLE/VS Code, and standard libraries (random, string).

Outcome:
Successfully generated strong, unpredictable passwords enhancing data security and user privacy.
